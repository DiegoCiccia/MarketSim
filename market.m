%% An artificial market
% The following code recreates the formulation of a Vernon Smith experiment
% about market formation. In a population of N sellers and N buyers of a single 
% good, each seller is handed a card containing the indication of his cost of
% production, so that he will be awarded the difference between the price
% at which he sells the good and its cost of production; at the same time,
% each buyer is handed a card that indicates the resale value of the good,
% such that he will be awarded the difference between the resale value and
% the purchase price for the good. 
% The transactions between the two groups occur according to the
% bid-asked-price reduction rule, so that sellers call out publicly asking 
% prices and buyers make their counterbid at a lower price. Competitive bidding
% occurs until an equilibrium is found at E.
